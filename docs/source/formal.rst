Formalism
=========
This page contains the formal presentation of most of the learning algorithms and models implemented in Jajapy.
Most of the following describe the algorithms for transition-labelled models, while *Jajapy* uses state-labelled one.
Nevertheless, the algorithms can simply be adapted from one formalism to another.
