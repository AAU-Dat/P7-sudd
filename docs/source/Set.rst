Set
===

In **jajapy**, a training / test set is a member of the Set class described below.

A Set has three attributes:

1. `sequences`: which is the list of all possible traces in the set.
2. `times`: which corresponds to the number of times each traces appears in the set.
3. `type`: that indicates which kind of traces are in `sequences`.

.. code-block:: python

	>>> import jajapy as ja
	>>> model = ja.HMM_random(3,['a','b'])
	>>> s = model.generateSet(5,3)
	>>> s.sequences
	[['a','b','b'],['a','b','a'],['b','a','a']]
	>>> s.times
	[1,3,1]
	>>> # model has generated 'abb' and 'baa' once, and 'aba' three times
	>>> s.type
	0
	>>> # if s.type == 0 then the traces are sequences of discrete observations, 
	>>> # i.e. they have been generated by a HMM or a MC (they can also be non-timed 
	>>> # traces of a CTMC).
